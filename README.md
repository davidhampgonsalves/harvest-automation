# Harvest Automation
These are some tools I use to generate boilerplate invoices on harvest (https://www.getharvest.com/).

## Installation
```
cp config.sample.json config.json
# Fill in your creds.
```

## Overrides
```
node index.js 2017-12-13
```

## Schedule (OSX)
Skip fighting with launchd and just setup via: http://launched.zerowidth.com/

__It also can serve as an example of how you can create an invoice using their painful v1 API.__
